      "        \"content\": \"Here are the customized instructions to prompt an LLM to process the table image into JSON and narrative text in Korean:\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\nAnalyze the provided image of a table to extract all relevant information and produce a comprehensive JSON object and corresponding narrative description. Focus on accurately representing the table\\u2019s structure, data, and relationships. All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative text must be in Korean.\\n\\n**Phase 1: Table Analysis & Component Identification**\\n\\n1.  **Identify Table Elements**:  Identify and thoroughly list every discernible element within the table. This includes the table\\u2019s title (if present), number, column headers, row headers, data cells, any footnotes or legends, and any surrounding text relevant to understanding the image\\u2019s content.\\n\\n2.  **Header-Data Relationships**: Carefully determine the relationship between each column header and the data within its respective column. Similarly, establish the relationship between each row header and the data within each row.  Document these relationships clearly.\\n\\n3.  **Indicator Recognition**:  Determine if there are any indicators displayed within cells (e.g., checkmarks, stars, plus signs, bold formatting, or other visual cues). If present, describe precisely how each indicator impacts the data represented. Record the exact label for each indicator. If there are indicators like 'yes','no','selectable' Indicate them precisely like the examples do.\\n\\n4.  **Data Type Awareness**:  Determine the types of data presented in each cell (e.g., numerical values, percentages, dates, textual descriptions).\\n\\n**Phase 2: JSON Object Construction**\\n\\n1.  **Summary JSON**: Create a summary JSON object reflecting the table\\u2019s overall structure and context.\\n    *   **Key Fields:** Include the following fields within the JSON object:\\n        *   `table_title`:  The title of the table (if present). Translate into Korean.\\n        *   `table_number`: The table number (if present). Translate into Korean.\\n        *   `description`: A brief textual description of the table\\u2019s content and purpose. Translate.\\n        *   `trends`: (Optional, only include if clearly apparent in the table) A description of any notably trends, patterns, or correlations observed across rows or columns. If applicable, translate.\\n        *   `currency`: (If applicable) The currency used within the table. Translate.\\n    *  **No optional fields if the context isn't clear.**\\n\\n2.  **Cell-Specific JSON**: For each data cell in the table, generate a separate JSON object.\\n    *   **Structure:** Each cell\\u2019s JSON object should include:\\n        *   `header_1`: The value of the first header (if applicable).\\n        *   `header_2`: The value of the second header (if applicable).\\n        *   `header_3`: The value of the third header (if applicable).\\n        *   `data_value`: The actual value contained within the data cell.  Ensure this is the precise value from the table.\\n        *   `data_type`:  Identify the type of data (e.g., \\\"number\\\", \\\"text\\\", \\\"percentage\\\").\\n\\n**Phase 3: Narrative Description Generation**\\n\\n1.  **Complete Sentences**: Construct a comprehensive narrative description of the table using a series of complete sentences. The sentences should accurately describe the table\\u2019s content, relationships, and overall theme.\\n\\n2.  **Relationship Emphasis**:  Prioritize describing the relationships between the headers, data cells, and trends. Explicitly state how different columns or rows are interconnected.\\n\\n3.  **Clarity and Conciseness**: Write the narrative in clear and concise language avoiding technical jargon.\\n\\n4.  **Inclusions**: Include explicit reference to all key elements: table title, figure number and the  overall purpose of the data representation.\\n\\n5.  **Translation**: Translate all sentences into Korean.\\n\\n6.  **Format**: Organize the narrative text in a logical order, starting with a general overview of the table and then moving to more specific details.\\n\\n**Phase 4 - Specific Table Details (apply to the image provided)**\\n\\nThe table presents data relating to CPI (Consumer Price Index) MoM (Month-over-Month) and YoY (Year-over-Year) indices for various economic indicators. The columns are labeled '\\ubbf8\\uad6d CPI MoM', '\\ubbf8\\uad6d CPI YoY', '\\ubbf8\\uad6d \\uadfc\\uc6d0PCE MoM', '\\uc720\\ub85c\\uc874 CPI MoM', \\u2018\\uc720\\ub85c\\uc874 CPI YoY\\u2019, and \\u2018\\uc601\\uad6d CPI MoM\\u2019. The rows exhibit data for the months \\u201823.10\\uc6d4,\\u2019 \\u201823.11\\uc6d4\\u2019, \\u201823.12\\uc6d4\\u2019, \\u201824.1\\uc6d4\\u2019, and \\u201824.3\\uc6d4'.\\n\\n**Final Output:**\\n\\nProvide a single JSONL file containing two arrays: the first with the summaryJSON object, and the second with individualJSON objects for each cell, followed by a Korean narrative explaining the table's content and relationships.\\n\\n**Crucial Note:** The entire output must be completely in Korean, including JSON keys, values, and the narrative text.\\n\\nDo NOT include any introductory or explanatory text beyond these instructions. Proceed directly to generating the output.\\n\"\n",

    "                    \"text\": \"You are a helpful assistant specialized in creating instructions for analyzing and transforming table images into JSON and narrative text. Your task is to analyze the provided image of a table and generate custom instructions that explain how to structure the content of the table into JSON and narrative text. Your output should include **only instructions**. Do not generate actual JSON or narrative text. Your response should be customized instructions that can be used to prompt an LLM to process the image content into JSON and narrative text accurately and reliably. Focus on providing comprehensive and customizable guidance that can be used in subsequent tasks.\\\\n\\\\nThe most important part of your task is to ensure that every single **relationship** between the cells, headers, and overall structure is **captured accurately**. It is not enough to convert the table cells into JSON individually; the **relationships between the data** (such as row and column headers, data groupings, and interactions) must be reflected in the final JSON.\\\\n\\\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Analyze the Table Structure**: **Identify and list all visible components** of the table. These could include the table title, table number, column headers, row headers, data cells, or any other visual elements.\\\\n  - Focus on identifying the **relationships** between headers and data cells. For example:\\\\n    - If the table has column and row headers, describe how the headers relate to the values in each cell.\\\\n    - If cells are grouped or have shared characteristics (e.g., by row or column), describe how these groups should be represented in JSON.\\\\n  - If there are **check marks**, **tick marks**, **filled boxes**, or other indicators that a value is selected:\\\\n    - **Original Text**: Create instructions to capture the question or field label as it appears, along with any numbering or lettering.\\\\n    - **Numbering or lettering**: Create instructions for capturing any numbering and lettering, if it exists, for these fields.\\\\n    - **Identify the Exact Options Available**: List each available option precisely as labeled in the table (e.g., \\\\\\\"Yes/No\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Male/Female\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Option A/Option B/Option C\\\\\\\") in your instructions.\\\\n    - Describe how to handle selection boxes:\\\\n      - For Yes/No or labeled choices, record the exact selected label (e.g., \\\\\\\"selected\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"No\\\\\\\").\\\\n      - For single checkboxes without labels, use \\\\\\\"true\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"false\\\\\\\" based on whether the box is marked.\\\\n      - For multi-selections, list all selected values in an array.\\\\n    - **Precision**: Use examples matching the table's visible content, avoiding assumptions.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Summary JSON Instructions**: Create detailed instructions for constructing a **summary JSON object** that captures high-level information, such as the table title, number, and main topics or themes. Use actual examples from the image, avoiding generic placeholders.\\\\n  - Add customized appropriate fields for the image based on your analysis, if they highlight key insights (e.g., trends across rows or columns). For example, you could add a \\\\\\\"trends\\\\\\\" field for any patterns or trends in the table. **Only add these fields if they highlight key insights about the image**!\\\\n  - Use any surrounding text to help clarify the meaning, context, structure, and purpose of the table.\\\\n  - Include the **table title and number** if they exist in the image or surrounding text. It is critical that the title and number be accurately represented in the summary JSON object.\\\\n    - Do not include the table title and number if they cannot be found.\\\\n    - Use the nomenclature in the table. If the table is called \\\\\\\"figure\\\\\\\" call it \\\\\\\"figure_title\\\\\\\" and  \\\\\\\"figure_number\\\\\\\". etc...\\\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n  - Here is an example with some of the fields mentioned. It  *must be customized* to the image to *capture the important information* being conveyed in the summary object. Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\\\"table_title\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Example Table\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"table_number\\\\\\\":5,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"X\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"trends\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Q\\\\\\\"}\\\\n```\\\\n  - If the table lacks a title or number, make it clear in the instructions that the JSON should reflect that it is missing.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Detailed JSON for Table Cells**: For each data cell in the table, provide instructions on how to create a **single JSON object** that reflects both the data in the cell and the **relationship** between that data and its headers.\\\\n  - If the table is organized in rows, describe how to capture the relationships between the **row header** and each corresponding cell in that row. For example:\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\\\"header_1\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Value_1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"header_2\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Value_2\\\\\\\"}\\\\n```\\\\n  - If the table is organized in columns, describe how to capture the relationships between the **column header** and each cell in that column.\\\\n  - **Ensure that every cell has both a key (based on headers) and a value (based on the cell's content)**, and the relationships between headers and values are reflected clearly.\\\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Table Narrative Instructions**: Provide instructions for narrating the contents of the JSON into **complete sentences** that describe the relationships between the cells.\\\\n  - The narrative must clearly explain the **contents** of the table and the **relationships** between headers and data in simple language.\\\\n  - Do not use technical terms like \\\\\\\"JSON object\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"narrative format\\\\\\\"; simply describe the table data in sentence form.\\\\n  - **Example of a narrative**:\\\\n    - \\\\\\\"In this table, the category is 'Food,' the amount is '100,' and the date is '01-01-2024.' Another entry in the table shows that the category is 'Transport,' the amount is '50,' and the date is '01-02-2024.'\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n5. **Final Organization**: After describing each table cell's content, instruct that the JSON objects should be grouped at the top into a **JSONL format** without indentation or extra formatting.\\\\n  - The narrative description should be grouped at the bottom, explaining the JSON content in full sentences.\\\\n\\\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\\\n\\\\n**Key points to remember**:\\\\n\\\\n- **Everything must be in Korean**: Ensure that all JSON keys, values, and narrative text are written in Korean, including translations of any labels in the image in other languages.\\\\n- **No paraphrasing**: The response must be based entirely on the elements visible in the image. Do not paraphrase or repeat the task instructions. Customize the response based on the specific content of the image.\\\\n- **No generic placeholders**: Use actual text and data from the image wherever possible. If no clear labels exist, create meaningful keys but avoid placeholders unless absolutely necessary.\\\\n\\\\nIt is also critical you not format the JSON objects with indentation or new lines between attributes. Only between the JSON objects themselves.\",\n",

These could include text, numbers, shapes, icons, lines, arrows, colors, groupings, etc. Be thorough in listing all the individual elements, focusing on **relevant relationships and insights** between them. This is the most important part. Relationships could include:\\\\n  - Elements linked by lines or arrows (e.g., showing flow, sequence, or connection).\\\\n  - Groupings by location on axes or timelines, proximity, color, or other visual cues (e.g., items that belong to the same category, family, or set).\\\\n  - Comparisons between elements (e.g., sizes, positions, directions).\\\\n  - Directionality or sequence indicated by arrows, lines, or ordering.\\\\n  - Any other **interactions** that tie elements together, such as overlapping shapes, aligned elements, or color-coded regions.\\\\n  - Higher-level patterns or themes visible in the diagram, especially if clarified by surrounding text.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Describe Relationships in JSON**: For each relationship identified in the image, explain how to capture it in JSON.

The narrative description should be grouped at the bottom, representing the JSON content in sentence form. Ensure the narrative corresponds directly to the JSON and provides a full description of the image.\\\\n\\\\n**Key points to remember**:\\\\n\\\\n- **Everything must be in English**: Ensure that all JSON keys, values, and narrative text are written in English, including translations of any labels in the image in other languages.\\\\n- **No paraphrasing**: The response must be based entirely on the elements visible in the image. Do not paraphrase or repeat the task instructions. Customize the response based on the specific content of the image.\\\\n- **No generic placeholders**: Use actual text and data from the image wherever possible. If no clear labels exist, create meaningful keys but avoid placeholders unless absolutely necessary.\\\\n- **Use surrounding text for context**: Refer to additional text to help identify themes, relationships, or trends, as well as the title or figure number if they are not within the image itself.\\\\n- **Only add fields like \\\\\"components\\\\\",\\\\\"trends\\\\\", and \\\\\"relationships\\\\\"** if they offer meaningful insights about the image.

Translate everything into Korean.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Analyze the Image**: Identify **all visible components** of the image. These could include text, numbers, shapes, icons, lines, arrows, colors, groupings, etc. Be thorough in listing all the individual elements, focusing on **relevant relationships and insights** between them. This is the most important part. Relationships could include:\\\\n  - Elements linked by lines or arrows (e.g., showing flow, sequence, or connection).\\\\n  - Groupings by location on axes or timelines, proximity, color, or other visual cues (e.g., items that belong to the same category, family, or set).\\\\n  - Comparisons between elements (e.g., sizes, positions, directions).\\\\n  - Directionality or sequence indicated by arrows, lines, or ordering.\\\\n  - Any other **interactions** that tie elements together, such as overlapping shapes, aligned elements, or color-coded regions.\\\\n  - Higher-level patterns or themes visible in the diagram, especially if clarified by surrounding text.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Describe Relationships in JSON**: For each relationship identified in the image, explain how to capture it in JSON. This might include:\\\\n  - Indicating a **direction** or **flow** between two elements connected by an arrow (e.g., `\\\\\"direction\\\\\":\\\\\"Element A flows to Element B\\\\\"`) if it conveys process or sequence.\\\\n  - **Grouping** elements that share a color, alignment, or proximity (e.g., `\\\\\"group\\\\\":\\\\\"green elements\\\\\",\\\\\"aligned_with\\\\\":\\\\\"central box\\\\\"`) to represent categories or clusters.\\\\n  - Expressing **comparative relationships** (e.g., `\\\\\"Element A is larger than Element B\\\\\"` or `\\\\\"Element A is above Element B\\\\\"`).\\\\n  - Assigning values from an axis or legend.\\\\n  - Capturing any patterns or trends, such as changes across a timeline, using surrounding text for additional insights.\\\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n  - Here is an example that you should customize to fit the image, if relationships must be described:\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\"element\\\\\":\\\\\"A\\\\\",\\\\\"relationship\\\\\":{\\\\\"connected_to\\\\\":\\\\\"B\\\\\",\\\\\"direction\\\\\":\\\\\"left to right\\\\\"}}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n3. **Create a Summary JSON Object**: After analyzing the elements and relationships, create a summary JSON object that captures the **overall structure, context, and purpose** of the image, including the relationships you identified and any themes drawn from surrounding text.\\\\n  - Use specific examples from the image to show how to construct the summary, but avoid placeholders or general terms.\\\\n  - If the figure has a title or a number or both, such as table 1 or figure 2, it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL that you create instructions to capture these titles and numbers within the summary JSON object.

Make sure that any lines, arrows, groupings, or comparisons are reflected in the JSON as attributes.\\\\n  - Ensure each JSON object includes attributes describing its relationships to other elements, such as:\\\\n    - `\\\\\"connected_to\\\\\":\\\\\"Element B\\\\\"`\\\\n    - `\\\\\"group\\\\\":\\\\\"blue items\\\\\"`\\\\n    - `\\\\\"relative_position\\\\\":\\\\\"above Element C\\\\\"`\\\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n  - If there are **check marks**, **tick marks**, **filled boxes**, or other indicators that a value is selected:\\\\n    - **Original Text**: Create instructions to capture the question or field label as it appears, along with any numbering or lettering.\\\\n    - **Numbering or lettering**: Create instructions for capturing any numbering and lettering, if it exists, for these fields.\\\\n    - **Identify the Exact Options Available**: List each available option precisely as labeled in the table (e.g., \\\\\"Yes/No\\\\\", \\\\\"Male/Female\\\\\", \\\\\"Option A/Option B/Option C\\\\\") in your instructions.\\\\n    - Describe how to handle selection boxes:\\\\n      - For Yes/No or labeled choices, record the exact selected label (e.g., \\\\\"selected\\\\\": \\\\\"No\\\\\").\\\\n      - For single checkboxes without labels, use \\\\\"true\\\\\" or \\\\\"false\\\\\" based on whether the box is marked.\\\\n      - For multi-selections, list all selected values in an array.\\\\n    - **Precision**: Use examples matching the table\\'s visible content, avoiding assumptions.\\\\n  - If the figure is a graph, bar chart or some other type of chart, create instructions to capture EVERY SINGLE data point in the chart.\\\\n    - It is ABSOLUTELY VITAL you **create instructions to capture every datapoint in the chart** COMPLETELY.\\\\n  - Include the relative changes between the data points in JSON as key-values.\\\\n  - Example:\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\"element\\\\\":\\\\\"Process A\\\\\",\\\\\"connected_to\\\\\":\\\\\"Process B\\\\\",\\\\\"direction\\\\\":\\\\\"flows to\\\\\"}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n5. **Narrative Instructions**: Provide guidance on how to convert the JSON into a narrative description. The narrative should describe the **relationships** between elements, clearly explaining how they connect or interact.\\\\n  - For example, \\\\\"Process A is connected to Process B, with an arrow showing a flow from left to right.\\\\\"\\\\n  - Avoid using placeholders like \\\\\"X\\\\\" or \\\\\"Y\\\\\"; base the narrative on the actual elements and relationships in the image.\\\\n\\\\n6. **Final Organization**: Once the individual JSON objects are described, instruct that the JSONL should be grouped at the top without indentation or extra formatting. The narrative description should be grouped at the bottom, representing the JSON content in sentence form. Ensure the narrative corresponds directly to the JSON and provides a full description of the image.\\\\n\\\\n**Key points to remember**:\\\\n\\\\n- **Everything must be in Korean**: Ensure that all JSON keys, values, and narrative text are written in Korean, including translations of any labels in the image in other languages.\\\\n- **No paraphrasing**: The response must be based entirely on the elements visible in the image. Do not paraphrase or repeat the task instructions. Customize the response based on the specific content of the image.\\\\n- **No generic placeholders**: Use actual text and data from the image wherever possible. If no clear labels exist, create meaningful keys but avoid placeholders unless absolutely necessary.\\\\n- **Use surrounding text for context**: Refer to additional text to help identify themes, relationships, or trends, as well as the title or figure number if they are not within the image itself.\\\\n- **Only add fields like \\\\\"components\\\\\",\\\\\"trends\\\\\", and \\\\\"relationships\\\\\"** if they offer meaningful insights about the image. Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n- **Figure/graph/chart title and number**: Create instructions to capture BOTH the figure title and number, if they exist, in the image. If they are not in the image, they may be found in the surrounding text. The entire figure title must be captured in **Korean** like this `{\\\\\"figure title\\\\\":\\\\\"TITLE\\\\\",\\\\\"figure number\\\\\":1}`, except translate \\\\\"figure title\\\\\" and \\\\\"figure number\\\\\" into Korean, as well as in the narrative text.\\\\n- Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n\\\\nThe goal is to ensure that the structure, relationships, and content of the image are fully captured in both JSON and the narrative, with insights enhanced by the surrounding text.\\\\n\\\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\\\n\\\\nIt is also critical you not format the JSON objects with indentation or new lines between attributes.

For example:\\\\n    - If the table has column and row headers, describe how the headers relate to the values in each cell.\\\\n    - If cells are grouped or have shared characteristics (e.g., by row or column), describe how these groups should be represented in JSON.\\\\n  - If there are **check marks**, **tick marks**, **filled boxes**, or other indicators that a value is selected:\\\\n    - **Original Text**: Create instructions to capture the question or field label as it appears, along with any numbering or lettering.\\\\n    - **Numbering or lettering**: Create instructions for capturing any numbering and lettering, if it exists, for these fields.\\\\n    - **Identify the Exact Options Available**: List each available option precisely as labeled in the table (e.g., \\\\\"Yes/No\\\\\", \\\\\"Male/Female\\\\\", \\\\\"Option A/Option B/Option C\\\\\") in your instructions.\\\\n    - Describe how to handle selection boxes:\\\\n      - For Yes/No or labeled choices, record the exact selected label (e.g., \\\\\"selected\\\\\": \\\\\"No\\\\\").\\\\n      - For single checkboxes without labels, use \\\\\"true\\\\\" or \\\\\"false\\\\\" based on whether the box is marked.\\\\n      - For multi-selections, list all selected values in an array.\\\\n    - **Precision**: Use examples matching the table\\'s visible content, avoiding assumptions.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Summary JSON Instructions**: Create detailed instructions for constructing a **summary JSON object** that captures high-level information, such as the table title, number, and main topics or themes. Use actual examples from the image, avoiding generic placeholders.\\\\n  - Add customized appropriate fields for the image based on your analysis, if they highlight key insights (e.g., trends across rows or columns). For example, you could add a \\\\\"trends\\\\\" field for any patterns or trends in the table. **Only add these fields if they highlight key insights about the image**!\\\\n  - Use any surrounding text to help clarify the meaning, context, structure, and purpose of the table.\\\\n  - Include the **table title and number** if they exist in the image or surrounding text. It is critical that the title and number be accurately represented in the summary JSON object.\\\\n    - Do not include the table title and number if they cannot be found.\\\\n    - Use the nomenclature in the table. If the table is called \\\\\"figure\\\\\" call it \\\\\"figure_title\\\\\" and  \\\\\"figure_number\\\\\". etc...\\\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n  - Here is an example with some of the fields mentioned. It  *must be customized* to the image to *capture the important information* being conveyed in the summary object. Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\"table_title\\\\\":\\\\\"Example Table\\\\\",\\\\\"table_number\\\\\":5,\\\\\"description\\\\\":\\\\\"X\\\\\",\\\\\"trends\\\\\":\\\\\"Q\\\\\"}\\\\n```\\\\n  - If the table lacks a title or number, make it clear in the instructions that the JSON should reflect that it is missing.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Detailed JSON for Table Cells**: For each data cell in the table, provide instructions on how to create a **single JSON object** that reflects both the data in the cell and the **relationship** between that data and its headers.\\\\n  - If the table is organized in rows, describe how to capture the relationships between the **row header** and each corresponding cell in that row. For example:\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\"header_1\\\\\":\\\\\"Value_1\\\\\",\\\\\"header_2\\\\\":\\\\\"Value_2\\\\\"}\\\\n```\\\\n  - If the table is organized in columns, describe how to capture the relationships between the **column header** and each cell in that column.\\\\n  - **Ensure that every cell has both a key (based on headers) and a value (based on the cell\\'s content)**, and the relationships between headers and values are reflected clearly.\\\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Table Narrative Instructions**: Provide instructions for narrating the contents of the JSON into **complete sentences** that describe the relationships between the cells.\\\\n  - The narrative must clearly explain the **contents** of the table and the **relationships** between headers and data in simple language.\\\\n  - Do not use technical terms like \\\\\"JSON object\\\\\" or \\\\\"narrative format\\\\\"; simply describe the table data in sentence form.\\\\n  - **Example of a narrative**:\\\\n    - \\\\\"In this table, the category is \\'Food,\\' the amount is \\'100,\\' and the date is \\'01-01-2024.\\' Another entry in the table shows that the category is \\'Transport,\\' the amount is \\'50,\\' and the date is \\'01-02-2024.\\'\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n5. **Final Organization**: After describing each table cell\\'s content, instruct that the JSON objects should be grouped at the top into a **JSONL format** without indentation or extra formatting.\\\\n  - The narrative description should be grouped at the bottom, explaining the JSON content in full sentences.\\\\n\\\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\\\n\\\\n**Key points to remember**:\\\\n\\\\n- **Everything must be in Korean**: Ensure that all JSON keys, values, and narrative text are written in Korean, including translations of any labels in the image in other languages.\\\\n- **No paraphrasing**: The response must be based entirely on the elements visible in the image. Do not paraphrase or repeat the task instructions. Customize the response based on the specific content of the image.\\\\n- **No generic placeholders**: Use actual text and data from the image wherever possible. If no clear labels exist, create meaningful keys but avoid placeholders unless absolutely necessary.\\\\n\\\\nIt is also critical you not format the JSON objects with indentation or new lines between attributes. Only between the JSON objects themselves.', 'type': 'text'}], 'role': 'system'}, {'content': [{'text': 'Here is an image of a table. Your task is to analyze the image and provide **custom instructions** on how to convert the table into JSON and narrative text, ensuring that both the **content** and the **relationships** between the elements in the table are captured accurately. Do not generate actual JSON or narrative text. Your response should be customized instructions that can be used to prompt an LLM to process the image content into JSON and narrative text accurately and reliably. Focus on providing comprehensive and customizable guidance that can be used in subsequent tasks.\\\\n\\\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\\\n\\\\n- **Identify and list all components**: Identify the table title, table number, column headers, row headers, data cells, and layout of information.\\\\n  - Use any surrounding text to help clarify the structure and purpose of the table.\\\\n  - Focus on the relationships between the headers and the data in each cell. For example, how does each column header relate to the values in that column? How do row headers correspond to the data in the rows?\\\\n  - Identify how the table lays out information: in columns, rows, or some combination.\\\\n\\\\n- **Create Summary JSON**: After analyzing the table, provide instructions for creating a **summary JSON object** that captures high-level information, such as the table title, number, and main headers. This should also include a description of the table\\'s purpose, main topics, or themes. Use actual examples from the image, avoiding generic placeholders.\\\\n  - Add customized appropriate fields for the image, based on your analysis, only if they convey key insights (e.g., recurring patterns or trends across rows or columns). For example, you could add a \\\\\"trends\\\\\" field for any patterns or trends in the table. **Only add these fields if they highlight key insights about the image**!\\\\n  - Use any surrounding text to help clarify the meaning, context, structure, and purpose of the table.\\\\n  - If a table title or table number exists in the image or surrounding text, make sure you capture this information in the summary JSON object and reflect it in the narrative\\\\n    - Do not include the table title and number if they cannot be found.\\\\n    - Use the nomenclature in the table. If the table is called \\\\\"figure\\\\\" call it \\\\\"figure_title\\\\\" and  \\\\\"figure_number\\\\\". etc...\\\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n  - Here is an example with some of the fields mentioned. Please *customize it* to the image to *capture the important information* being conveyed in the summary object. Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\"table_title\\\\\":\\\\\"Example Table\\\\\",\\\\\"table_number\\\\\":5,\\\\\"description\\\\\":\\\\\"X\\\\\",\\\\\"trends\\\\\":\\\\\"Q\\\\\"}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n- **Create Detailed JSON for Table Cells**: Provide instructions on how to convert each cell into a **single JSON object** that reflects both the **data in the cell** and the **relationship between the headers and data**.\\\\n  - For row-based tables, explain how to capture the relationships between row headers and each cell.\\\\n  - For column-based tables, explain how to capture the relationships between column headers and each cell.\\\\n  - It is **vital** that every cell has both a **key** (based on headers) and a **value** (based on cell content).\\\\n  - If there are **check marks**, **tick marks**, **filled boxes**, or other indicators that a value is selected:\\\\n    - **Original Text**: Create instructions to capture the question or field label as it appears, along with any numbering or lettering.\\\\n    - **Numbering or lettering**: Create instructions for capturing any numbering and lettering, if it exists, for these fields.\\\\n    - **Identify the Exact Options Available**: List each available option precisely as labeled in the table (e.g., \\\\\"Yes/No\\\\\", \\\\\"Male/Female\\\\\", \\\\\"Option A/Option B/Option C\\\\\") in your instructions.\\\\n    - Describe how to handle selection boxes:\\\\n      - For Yes/No or labeled choices, record the exact selected label (e.g., \\\\\"selected\\\\\": \\\\\"No\\\\\").\\\\n      - For single checkboxes without labels, use \\\\\"true\\\\\" or \\\\\"false\\\\\" based on whether the box is marked.\\\\n      - For multi-selections, list all selected values in an array.\\\\n    - **Precision**: Use examples matching the table\\'s visible content, avoiding assumptions.\\\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\\\n\\\\n- **Narrate the JSON**: Provide instructions for how to narrate each JSON object into a complete sentence, explaining the relationships between the table\\'s headers and data in simple language.\\\\n  - Ensure that the narrative text is written without referring to technical terms like \\\\\"JSON object\\\\\" or \\\\\"narrative format.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n- **Final JSONL and Narrative Instructions**: Group the JSON objects together at the top in a JSONL format (without indentation).\\\\n  - The narrative text should be grouped at the bottom and should describe the contents of the table in full sentences.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Notes**:\\\\n\\\\n- It is crucial that your instructions focus on capturing **relationships between table headers and data cells** rather than just converting cells individually.\\\\n- Use the surrounding text to capture additional context and high-level insights.\\\\n- Make sure that both the JSON and the narrative descriptions reflect the **relationships** between the elements, such as how headers correspond to cell values.\\\\n- It is absolutely vital that you create instructions to capture BOTH the table title and number, if they exist in the image or surrounding text, in the summary JSON object. The entire table title must be captured IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE CONTENT like this `{\\\\\"table title\\\\\":\\\\\"TITLE\\\\\",\\\\\"table number\\\\\":1}`, except translate \\\\\"table title\\\\\" and \\\\\"table number\\\\\" into the language of the content.\\\\n- Ensure that the instructions are fully customized based on the content of the image. Do not paraphrase or repeat the instructions from this task request—create a custom response specific to the image provided.\\\\n\\\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\\\n\\\\nPlease make it clear that the JSONL should not contain indentation, formatting, or new lines. \\\\nPlease provide the LLM prompt without additional commentary or notes.\\\\nRemember, it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL you capture ALL of the original information conveyed in the table.\\\\n\\\\nHere is the image of what I think is a table.
