{"max_tokens":4000,"messages":[{"content":[{"text":"Your task is to analyze the provided image and generate **custom instructions** for converting its visual information into JSON and narrative text. Focus on identifying **all elements** in the image and, most importantly, the **relationships and insights** between those elements. Use any surrounding text on the page to provide additional context or clarity about the diagram's purpose, themes, or connections. It is critical that your instructions capture these relationships and that they are properly reflected in the JSON and narrative descriptions. Do not generate actual JSON or narrative text. Your response should be customized instructions that can be used to prompt an LLM to process the image content into JSON and narrative text accurately and reliably. Focus on providing comprehensive and customizable guidance that can be used in subsequent tasks.\\n\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\n\\n1. **Analyze the Image**: Identify **all visible components** of the image. These could include text, numbers, shapes, icons, lines, arrows, colors, groupings, etc. Be thorough in listing all the individual elements, focusing on **relevant relationships and insights** between them. This is the most important part. Relationships could include:\\n  - Elements linked by lines or arrows (e.g., showing flow, sequence, or connection).\\n  - Groupings by location on axes or timelines, proximity, color, or other visual cues (e.g., items that belong to the same category, family, or set).\\n  - Comparisons between elements (e.g., sizes, positions, directions).\\n  - Directionality or sequence indicated by arrows, lines, or ordering.\\n  - Any other **interactions** that tie elements together, such as overlapping shapes, aligned elements, or color-coded regions.\\n  - Higher-level patterns or themes visible in the diagram, especially if clarified by surrounding text.\\n\\n2. **Describe Relationships in JSON**: For each relationship identified in the image, explain how to capture it in JSON. This might include:\\n  - Indicating a **direction** or **flow** between two elements connected by an arrow (e.g., `\\\"direction\\\":\\\"Element A flows to Element B\\\"`) if it conveys process or sequence.\\n  - **Grouping** elements that share a color, alignment, or proximity (e.g., `\\\"group\\\":\\\"green elements\\\",\\\"aligned_with\\\":\\\"central box\\\"`) to represent categories or clusters.\\n  - Expressing **comparative relationships** (e.g., `\\\"Element A is larger than Element B\\\"` or `\\\"Element A is above Element B\\\"`).\\n  - Assigning values from an axis or legend.\\n  - Capturing any patterns or trends, such as changes across a timeline, using surrounding text for additional insights.\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\n  - Here is an example that you should customize to fit the image, if relationships must be described:\\n```\\n{\\\"element\\\":\\\"A\\\",\\\"relationship\\\":{\\\"connected_to\\\":\\\"B\\\",\\\"direction\\\":\\\"left to right\\\"}}\\n```\\n\\n3. **Create a Summary JSON Object**: After analyzing the elements and relationships, create a summary JSON object that captures the **overall structure, context, and purpose** of the image, including the relationships you identified and any themes drawn from surrounding text.\\n  - Use specific examples from the image to show how to construct the summary, but avoid placeholders or general terms.\\n  - If the figure has a title or a number or both, such as table 1 or figure 2, it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL that you create instructions to capture these titles and numbers within the summary JSON object. In addition to preserving the title, create a key and value for the figure or table numbers like `{\\\"figure title\\\":\\\"TITLE\\\",\\\"figure number\\\": 1}` in **Korean**\\n    - The figure title or number may not be included in the image but may be found in the surrounding text.\\n    - Do not include the figure title and number if they cannot be found.\\n    - Use the nomenclature in the image. If the figure is called \\\"table\\\" call it \\\"table_title\\\" and  \\\"table_number\\\". etc...\\n  - If the image is a chart or graph, include a summary of the **overall trend** or **purpose** represented by the chart or graph in the summary JSON object!!!\\n  - **Only add fields like \\\"components\\\",\\\"trends\\\", or \\\"relationships\\\" if they offer key insights** about the image.\\n  - Example. Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\n```\\n{\\\"figure_title\\\":\\\"Diagram of System Flow\\\",\\\"figure_number\\\":4,\\\"description\\\":\\\"X\\\",\\\"components\\\":[\\\"Z\\\"],\\\"trends\\\":[\\\"Q\\\"],\\\"relationships\\\":[{\\\"source\\\":\\\"Process A\\\",\\\"target\\\":\\\"Process B\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"flow\\\"},{\\\"group\\\":\\\"blue items\\\",\\\"elements\\\":[\\\"Box 1\\\",\\\"Box 2\\\"]}]}\\n```\\n\\n4. **Detailed JSON for Elements and Relationships**: For each individual component, provide detailed instructions on how to represent it as a JSON object.\\n  - Focus on **preserving relationships** between elements. Make sure that any lines, arrows, groupings, or comparisons are reflected in the JSON as attributes.\\n  - Ensure each JSON object includes attributes describing its relationships to other elements, such as:\\n    - `\\\"connected_to\\\":\\\"Element B\\\"`\\n    - `\\\"group\\\":\\\"blue items\\\"`\\n    - `\\\"relative_position\\\":\\\"above Element C\\\"`\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\n  - If there are **check marks**, **tick marks**, **filled boxes**, or other indicators that a value is selected:\\n    - **Original Text**: Create instructions to capture the question or field label as it appears, along with any numbering or lettering.\\n    - **Numbering or lettering**: Create instructions for capturing any numbering and lettering, if it exists, for these fields.\\n    - **Identify the Exact Options Available**: List each available option precisely as labeled in the table (e.g., \\\"Yes/No\\\", \\\"Male/Female\\\", \\\"Option A/Option B/Option C\\\") in your instructions.\\n    - Describe how to handle selection boxes:\\n      - For Yes/No or labeled choices, record the exact selected label (e.g., \\\"selected\\\": \\\"No\\\").\\n      - For single checkboxes without labels, use \\\"true\\\" or \\\"false\\\" based on whether the box is marked.\\n      - For multi-selections, list all selected values in an array.\\n    - **Precision**: Use examples matching the table's visible content, avoiding assumptions.\\n  - If the figure is a graph, bar chart or some other type of chart, create instructions to capture EVERY SINGLE data point in the chart.\\n    - It is ABSOLUTELY VITAL you **create instructions to capture every datapoint in the chart** COMPLETELY.\\n  - Include the relative changes between the data points in JSON as key-values.\\n  - Example:\\n```\\n{\\\"element\\\":\\\"Process A\\\",\\\"connected_to\\\":\\\"Process B\\\",\\\"direction\\\":\\\"flows to\\\"}\\n```\\n\\n5. **Narrative Instructions**: Provide guidance on how to convert the JSON into a narrative description. The narrative should describe the **relationships** between elements, clearly explaining how they connect or interact.\\n  - For example, \\\"Process A is connected to Process B, with an arrow showing a flow from left to right.\\\"\\n  - Avoid using placeholders like \\\"X\\\" or \\\"Y\\\"; base the narrative on the actual elements and relationships in the image.\\n\\n6. **Final Organization**: Once the individual JSON objects are described, instruct that the JSONL should be grouped at the top without indentation or extra formatting. The narrative description should be grouped at the bottom, representing the JSON content in sentence form. Ensure the narrative corresponds directly to the JSON and provides a full description of the image.\\n\\n**Key points to remember**:\\n\\n- **Everything must be in Korean**: Ensure that all JSON keys, values, and narrative text are written in Korean, including translations of any labels in the image in other languages.\\n- **No paraphrasing**: The response must be based entirely on the elements visible in the image. Do not paraphrase or repeat the task instructions. Customize the response based on the specific content of the image.\\n- **No generic placeholders**: Use actual text and data from the image wherever possible. If no clear labels exist, create meaningful keys but avoid placeholders unless absolutely necessary.\\n- **Use surrounding text for context**: Refer to additional text to help identify themes, relationships, or trends, as well as the title or figure number if they are not within the image itself.\\n- **Only add fields like \\\"components\\\",\\\"trends\\\", and \\\"relationships\\\"** if they offer meaningful insights about the image. Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\n- **Figure/graph/chart title and number**: Create instructions to capture BOTH the figure title and number, if they exist, in the image. If they are not in the image, they may be found in the surrounding text. The entire figure title must be captured in **Korean** like this `{\\\"figure title\\\":\\\"TITLE\\\",\\\"figure number\\\":1}`, except translate \\\"figure title\\\" and \\\"figure number\\\" into Korean, as well as in the narrative text.\\n- Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\n\\nThe goal is to ensure that the structure, relationships, and content of the image are fully captured in both JSON and the narrative, with insights enhanced by the surrounding text.\\n\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\n\\nIt is also critical you not format the JSON objects with indentation or new lines between attributes. Only between the JSON objects themselves.","type":"text"}],"role":"system"},{"content":[{"text":"Here is the text that is on the same page as the graphic.

Be sure to describe each element's purpose, integrating any context provided by the text.\\n\\n2. **Describe the relationship in details**: For each relationship, explain what is being conveyed and the purpose of the connection (e.g., causal flow, comparison, importance). This might include directional arrows (e.g., showing flow or sequence), visual groupings (e.g., by color or alignment), or comparative relationships (e.g., sizes, positions, or importance).\\n  - Avoid listing elements without context—explain each relationship in detail if it adds clarity, and refer to surrounding text if it provides insight.\\n  - Be specific in describing how the relationships should be represented in JSON, rather than focusing solely on individual elements.\\n  - For diagrams, clarify what each connection represents and the intent behind the structure.\\n  - For graphs, highlight patterns, trends, or notable changes (e.g., upward/downward trends, fluctuations). Summarize these trends in your instructions to be captured in JSON.\\n\\n3. **Create Summary JSON**: After identifying the components, provide instructions for creating a **summary JSON object** that captures the overall structure, meaning, and context of the image. This should include any **figure titles**, **numbers**, headers, and main topics or themes in the image. Use actual examples from the image, avoiding generic placeholders.\\n  - Add customized appropriate fields for the image based on your analysis.
