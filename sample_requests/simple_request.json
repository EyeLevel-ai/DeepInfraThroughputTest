Your task is to analyze the provided image of a table and generate custom instructions that explain how to structure the content of the table into JSON and narrative text. Your output should include **only instructions**. Do not generate actual JSON or narrative text. Your response should be customized instructions that can be used to prompt an LLM to process the image content into JSON and narrative text accurately and reliably. Focus on providing comprehensive and customizable guidance that can be used in subsequent tasks.\\n\\nThe most important part of your task is to ensure that every single **relationship** between the cells, headers, and overall structure is **captured accurately**. It is not enough to convert the table cells into JSON individually; the **relationships between the data** (such as row and column headers, data groupings, and interactions) must be reflected in the final JSON.\\n\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\n\\n1. **Analyze the Table Structure**: **Identify and list all visible components** of the table. These could include the table title, table number, column headers, row headers, data cells, or any other visual elements.\\n  - Focus on identifying the **relationships** between headers and data cells. For example:\\n    - If the table has column and row headers, describe how the headers relate to the values in each cell.\\n    - If cells are grouped or have shared characteristics (e.g., by row or column), describe how these groups should be represented in JSON.\\n  - If there are **check marks**, **tick marks**, **filled boxes**, or other indicators that a value is selected:\\n    - **Original Text**: Create instructions to capture the question or field label as it appears, along with any numbering or lettering.\\n    - **Numbering or lettering**: Create instructions for capturing any numbering and lettering, if it exists, for these fields.\\n    - **Identify the Exact Options Available**: List each available option precisely as labeled in the table (e.g., \\\"Yes/No\\\", \\\"Male/Female\\\", \\\"Option A/Option B/Option C\\\") in your instructions.\\n    - Describe how to handle selection boxes:\\n      - For Yes/No or labeled choices, record the exact selected label (e.g., \\\"selected\\\": \\\"No\\\").\\n      - For single checkboxes without labels, use \\\"true\\\" or \\\"false\\\" based on whether the box is marked.\\n      - For multi-selections, list all selected values in an array.\\n    - **Precision**: Use examples matching the table's visible content, avoiding assumptions.\\n\\n2. **Summary JSON Instructions**: Create detailed instructions for constructing a **summary JSON object** that captures high-level information, such as the table title, number, and main topics or themes. Use actual examples from the image, avoiding generic placeholders.\\n  - Add customized appropriate fields for the image based on your analysis, if they highlight key insights (e.g., trends across rows or columns). For example, you could add a \\\"trends\\\" field for any patterns or trends in the table. **Only add these fields if they highlight key insights about the image**!\\n  - Use any surrounding text to help clarify the meaning, context, structure, and purpose of the table.\\n  - Include the **table title and number** if they exist in the image or surrounding text. It is critical that the title and number be accurately represented in the summary JSON object.\\n    - Do not include the table title and number if they cannot be found.\\n    - Use the nomenclature in the table. If the table is called \\\"figure\\\" call it \\\"figure_title\\\" and  \\\"figure_number\\\". etc...\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\n  - Here is an example with some of the fields mentioned. It  *must be customized* to the image to *capture the important information* being conveyed in the summary object. Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\n```\\n{\\\"table_title\\\":\\\"Example Table\\\",\\\"table_number\\\":5,\\\"description\\\":\\\"X\\\",\\\"trends\\\":\\\"Q\\\"}\\n```\\n  - If the table lacks a title or number, make it clear in the instructions that the JSON should reflect that it is missing.\\n\\n3. **Detailed JSON for Table Cells**: For each data cell in the table, provide instructions on how to create a **single JSON object** that reflects both the data in the cell and the **relationship** between that data and its headers.\\n  - If the table is organized in rows, describe how to capture the relationships between the **row header** and each corresponding cell in that row. For example:\\n```\\n{\\\"header_1\\\":\\\"Value_1\\\",\\\"header_2\\\":\\\"Value_2\\\"}\\n```\\n  - If the table is organized in columns, describe how to capture the relationships between the **column header** and each cell in that column.\\n  - **Ensure that every cell has both a key (based on headers) and a value (based on the cell's content)**, and the relationships between headers and values are reflected clearly.\\n  - Translate all keys, values, and text into Korean.\\n\\n4. **Table Narrative Instructions**: Provide instructions for narrating the contents of the JSON into **complete sentences** that describe the relationships between the cells.\\n  - The narrative must clearly explain the **contents** of the table and the **relationships** between headers and data in simple language.\\n  - Do not use technical terms like \\\"JSON object\\\" or \\\"narrative format\\\"; simply describe the table data in sentence form.\\n  - **Example of a narrative**:\\n    - \\\"In this table, the category is 'Food,' the amount is '100,' and the date is '01-01-2024.' Another entry in the table shows that the category is 'Transport,' the amount is '50,' and the date is '01-02-2024.'\\\"\\n\\n5. **Final Organization**: After describing each table cell's content, instruct that the JSON objects should be grouped at the top into a **JSONL format** without indentation or extra formatting.\\n  - The narrative description should be grouped at the bottom, explaining the JSON content in full sentences.\\n\\n**Language Consistency**: All instructions, JSON keys, values, and the narrative description must be in **Korean**. Translate everything into Korean.\\n\\n**Key points to remember**:\\n\\n- **Everything must be in Korean**: Ensure that all JSON keys, values, and narrative text are written in Korean, including translations of any labels in the image in other languages.\\n- **No paraphrasing**: The response must be based entirely on the elements visible in the image. Do not paraphrase or repeat the task instructions. Customize the response based on the specific content of the image.\\n- **No generic placeholders**: Use actual text and data from the image wherever possible. If no clear labels exist, create meaningful keys but avoid placeholders unless absolutely necessary.\\n\\nIt is also critical you not format the JSON objects with indentation or new lines between attributes. Only between the JSON objects themselves.",
