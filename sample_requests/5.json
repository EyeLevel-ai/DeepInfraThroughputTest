( 2 ) Image Resolution : Proprietary\\n commercial models typically employ a dynamic resolution\\n approach , preserving the original aspect ratio to facilitate\\n detailed scene and document understanding . In contrast ,\\n open - source models generally train with fixed resolutions\\n [ 20 , 25 , 58 , 67 , 112 , 137 ] , such as 336x336 and 448 × 448 ,\\n leading to a considerable gap in capabilities relative to com-\\n mercial counterparts . ( 3 ) Multilingual Capability : Propri-\\n etary models often leverage extensive multilingual datasets\\n for training , enhancing their performance across diverse\\n languages . However , open - source models predominantly\\n utilize English data , relying on the zero - shot capabilities of\\n LLMs for other languages , e.g. LLaVA - NeXT [ 60 ] .
